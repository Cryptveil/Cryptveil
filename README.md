Hey, I'm Grellheist!

Currently work as a Network ADM/Operator.

My current goal is to become a Web Developer (alternatively a DevOps engineer).

Always improving something about myself, always struggling no matter how hard things get.

Becoming the best at what I do is what drives me.

I'll try my best to keep my GitHub updated with my coding progress.
