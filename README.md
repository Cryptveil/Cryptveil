Hey, I'm Grellheist!

Currently work as a Network ADM/Operator.

My current goal is to become a DevOps Engineer (leaning more towards the Dev side).

Always improving something about myself, always struggling no matter how hard things get.

Becoming the best at what I do is what drives me.

I'll try my best to keep my GitHub updated with my coding progress.

*There is absolutely nothing I cannot do with my sheer force of will.*
